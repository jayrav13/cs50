0.  Per Wikipedia, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is an English word that refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis.
1.  getrusage leverages computer time and resource data to determine how long a task takes.
2.  There are 16 variables in struct rusage.
3.  They are passed by reference so that the function doesn't create local variables, but rather edits variables in the program itself.
4.  Unlike my method of loading data into a linked list, this method looks at the for loop at a character level.
Only if the character is valid (i.e. alpha or apostraphe), the letter is added to the string which builds a 
new word. If the word is "too long" (i.e. somehow appears to be more than the longest english word, which is
45 characters, the balance of the word is ignored. At the end of the word, index is set back to 0 to start
at a new word.

If the character at a specific index is a number, ignore the rest of the word, similar to if it was too long.

If the above two if statements aren't "triggered", a null terminator is added. The word's spelling is tested, and
once done counters are updated and index is reset.

5.  We may not be able to see each word at a time because a line may contain multiple words.
6.  They are set up as such because the function should not have he capability to alter the word.
7.  I used a simple linked list with a linear structure. Each node allows for storage of a word and pointer
to next node.
8.  It is currently on its first iteration and is potentially running at 27x slower than what's possible. 
Need to expedite the process by implementing a hash table next!
9.  I did implement some methods to speed up the check method, but additional improvements await!
10. I didn't like my ability to compare the word to the fgets version of the word with a "\n" at the end. 
But it was the best I could do thus far!
