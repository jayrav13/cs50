# Harvard CS50, Data Structures & Algorithms

Here is a repo of my coursework through Harvard CS50, primarily done in C. Towards the end of the course, we were also introduced to web development (PHP, MySQL, JavaScript + HTML/CSS). My final project for this class was an iOS app called Midloc which has it's own repo!
